# Introduction

Every year the Friday after Thanksgiving is a day of shopping. Known as Black Friday, the day is characterized by high demand for retail goods. This paper aims to understand the average shopper and the customer behavior on Black Friday for one retail store. There are two hypotheses this paper will study: 

Hypothesis 1: Average shopper purchase of people living in City A is more than those living in cities B and C. 
Hypothesis 2: The most profitable product categories are categories 1, 5 and 8. 

Through the analysis of the above hypotheses, this paper will provide suggestions to the retail store on which segment, demographic and city category the store can focus its marketing efforts on. Lastly, using predictive analytics this report suggests the customers the retail firm can target to maximize Black Friday profits.
